   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@bazzly</a> : Perfect! What I would do is look into responsive design and hybrid apps. These apps run in a web view and can act like a native app. You will only need to focus on web tech.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@daniraay</a> : You’ll be fine! Swift is a newer language so it’s good easy to catch on! You can also keep using Web technologies and simply build Web Apps and put them into apps called hybrid apps.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@veryangryshahzoda</a> : Game Dev is a place where I like to pour my learned knowledge into! If you want to start I would pick up any popular game engine! Unity3D or Game Maker Studio are my favorites. Go through their tutorials and joint he forums. It took me a few years of tutorials before I really was writing my own code! When start it’s always best to start with the basics and master them first!

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@danizan_dani</a> : For your game what you need to do before anythting is go online and search for a game design documentation template. You need to write out your entire game start to finish on paper first. Then you will have an idea of the parts that you will be able to build. You’ll be able to do this in small pieces at a time rather than looking at the entire project as a whole.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@edushola</a> : GM Studio is still one of my favorite programs on the planet. I have made desktop applications, games, video, sounds, everything with it. I really like game mechanics more than game design which is sort of why I wanted to make my own engine.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@innocent_rathogwa</a> : Coding can be pretty difficult to grasp. I started off my coding thing that I actually would like to code. That was games! If you find a topic that you like to code, web, apps, games, CLI, it won’t seem so demotivating because you will be creating programs you like. It took me almost 3 years of game dev before I was able to really write my own code. Try to break problems in to smaller bits that you can solve separately

   <h4 class="writingTitle"><a class="post-link" href="/2017/02/12/starting-out-in-the-coding-industry-python">What would you recommend for somebody starting out in the coding industry? Right now I'm learning Python</a></h4>
   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@j.o.d.s.o.n</a> : Python is a great first language for starting out! The best thing to do right now is focus on one language heavily. Then once you understand programming more in general you will be able to pick up and understand other language topics much easier. A super recommendation is try to get an internship with a development company as soon as possible. They will give you real experience that is hard to find coding by yourself.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@traywitthemac11_808mafia</a> : I think you should start with a complete documentation. Before I ever start a project I write one usually around 3-20 pages with details about each part of the game. I do this for personal and professional projects

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@j.frank1980</a> : Ubuntu 16.04. Easy to setup and install MySQL or really anything pretty quickly. I usually run all my web software on Ubuntu with Node.JS or PHP using MySQL for databases. I prefer to just use the command line unless it’s on a system with a bunch of resources and I want to have the CLI and a web browser open at the same time learning about setting something up. It is usually easier to simply SSH in and copy and paste from your main machine.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@sousatg</a> : My first game was actually a MMO that was over 50k lines of code and is still one of my favorite projects. I wrote it over a couple years during a live stream. It took me an extremely long time to write but I learned something important. Sometimes being extremely organized will get you much farther than being a super knowledgeable programmer. I wrote out a complete game documentation and built each piece to exact specification. It’s still a project I can easily open up and work on even though the code was written 5-6 years ago when I first started programming.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@unspeaking</a> : I understand that is can be quite intimidating! I got into coding making small games. Over time I got into modifying network servers in c#, c++, and Java. Now I do full stack web development using JavaScript, PHP, ColdFusion. You might notice that is a lot of languages to be messing with! Once you learn one language you can learn other ones very quickly. I would push you to just start with JavaScript and web tech. My favorite starting place is w3schools.com.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@programming.de</a> : PHP is a server side language and you might not be using it for your Android project. I would take a look into HTML, CSS, and Javascript by making websites. Then package them inside an apps webview using Cordova.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@lord_of_a_thousand_worlds</a> : The best way to learn for me is by doing. Find a website you like and practice by trying to recreate a part of it. Do this for all the sites you like. If you have to inspect the source code delete the project and start over.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@_.ehs3._</a> : I would not worry about that to much. Just about any language can be used for game development, C#, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Haxe, if you learn one language you will be able to pick up other ones. Find one you like to use for game dev and learn it to the best of your ability. Then move onto other languages

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@stef_nielson</a> : Okay! That is alright! That happens to everyone. It’s hard to grasp code because it’s actually a different way of thinking. It’s actually much more simple! But that makes it weird. What I would do is try codeacademy course or two so you can get the basics. Write down these: Variables, Operators, Conditions, Loops, and Input/Output. With those few things you can basically do just about anything with code. If you find out exactly how each of those work you will be able to understand code a bit better!

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@muhammad_sabr_</a> : I would learn Web Development. Javascript, CSS, HTML5. Learn how those three work then learn a bit about some frameworks like BootStrap, Materialize. Then you can use applications like Cordova to quickly wrap your apps and deploy! Learning those will take much time so stay focused!

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@scipioakaceaser</a> : So you understand I was very hard headed. It took me almost 3 years of game dev before I could write my own code. In between that I was simply copy/paste other peoples tutorials like Lego pieces. And I kept making the Lego pieces smaller until I got down to the 2 pin ones and that gave me a lot more flexibility.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@r.y_le</a> : I think you should pick up any language that interests you. My favorite language was Game Maker Language and I got zero respect for using it. I was even making applications with it! But you should use the language you like rather than the best language. Java is very powerful. I typically use JavaScript because I’m okay with less performance for the trade of being able to run it anywhere. Plus the benefit of it being a fun language for me to use. You’ll know you found the right language when you can’t sleep at night because you are wrapped up dreaming of its functions and syntax and that problem your trying to solve using it!

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@kingjosh3</a> : I am really into Web Development and in any IDE for making native apps there is a component called Web View which allows you to build apps using Web tech then put it inside a Web view. Look up hybrid apps and Cordova. Go to Microsoft and their community edition which has Cordova built in. They have great tutorials! :]

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@daniraay</a> : When I first got mine it was having an issue like that. The hard drive was not good and I changed it to an SSD. Then I broke the power cable and it wasn’t actually charging. There was still a light on the cable so I thought it was okay. I would go to Best Buy or Microcenter and test on one of their power cables.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@awakenmarketingsolutions</a> : Hi! Start small and do many tutorials! I started with Game Maker back during Game Maker 6 9+ years ago and messed with Unity3D the past year. If you like coding and web I would certainly grab the PhaseJS game engine! PhaserJS is a total monster for gamedev let me know if you need anything else! You already know practice practice practice

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@sousatg</a> : Ionic is one of the best tools I’ve seen. What PhonGap and Cordova do is basically the same. They wrap your web app into a native webview so people can download your web app on the store. They also provide much much more than that allowing you to tap into native device interfaces like the GPS, gyroscope, audio, and storage. Their performance is extremely good. If you need more grab the Crosswalk plugin and at that point the difference in native and your web apps will be no difference

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@vespageorge30</a> : I learned coding over the internet. I wouldn’t consider it being self taught because I still learned from many other people over the internet in the way you would learn at university. Three years after highschool I did try out a few classes in college for software development and hold a 4.0GPA

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@angry_randall20</a> : Make sure you save your code. Glue your fingers for CTRL - S. Everytime you type a line press CTRL-S. Also check out the Brackets editor. The live preview will let you see your code changes in real time!

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@permanar_</a> : What I like to do to practice or learn something is old fashioned repitition. Find a website you like a bunch and try to make a copy of something on it. Like the login page. Make the page function by console logging the information that page would need to output. Delete it and try again without inspecting the source!

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@warismunadar</a> : I think one of the best places to get started is w3schools.com. Go through each of the tutorials for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I think starting with web tech is more exciting than other languages because it is very visual when you create or change something.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@jverdi</a> : I started by learning everything off w3schools.com. To get better I would consistently take on projects that are way more than I should have been able to handle. I make a plan and stick to it. If you can’t solve something break it into smaller problems that you can solve individually. When I start coding in any language I would do to 10-20 times. Create something small a website or game. Then delete it and do it again until it drilled into my head.

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@aadi._n</a> : You can’t go wrong with a macbook that has an i5/i7 processor. They are very comfortable for coding and multitasking vs windows 10. For Windows I would look into XPS 15, Sony Vaio Flip 15, anything Lenovo has good build quality. You should buy used laptops have pretty low resale value and some from 3-4 years ago have very high performance per dollar. I current use a 2011 17in MacBook Pro that I purchased for 900 USD

   <p class="writingExcerpt"><a href="https://instagram.com/">@ghaziimuharam</a> : I play around with a bit of anything. On personal projects I write most of my code on no frameworks. I like to keep focus on being organized and structured from the beginning making some frameworks sometimes get in the way. When working with a team I almost always want to be using a framework because it will help everyone be on the same page and structure!
