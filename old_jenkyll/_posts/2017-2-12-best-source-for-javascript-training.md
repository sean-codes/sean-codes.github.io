I started by learning everything off w3schools.com. To get better I would consistently take on projects that are way more than I should have been able to handle. I make a plan and stick to it. If you can't solve something break it into smaller problems that you can solve individually. When I start coding in any language I would do to 10-20 times. Create something small a website or game. Then delete it and do it again until it drilled into my head.
