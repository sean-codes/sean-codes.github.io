title: I want to ask toy that OS (Operating System) do you use for coding Node.JS apps? I don't know if windows is good.

I am typically under Windows 10 all day. I stick to Web based languages so the OS shouldn't matter. Use git bash and do npm install devtool -g and run your node app using devtool myNodeApp.js. Pick any OS you like Linux, Windows, Mac I like Windows on desktop and Mac for mobile/laptop
