title: Looking to buy a laptop. Can you tell me a good laptop under 1,000 USD

You can't go wrong with a macbook that has an i5/i7 processor. They are very comfortable for coding and multitasking vs windows 10. For Windows I would look into XPS 15, Sony Vaio Flip 15, anything Lenovo has good build quality. You should buy used laptops have pretty low resale value and some from 3-4 years ago have very high performance per dollar. I current use a 2011 17in MacBook Pro that I purchased for 900 USD
