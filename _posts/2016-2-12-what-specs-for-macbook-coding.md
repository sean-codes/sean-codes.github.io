title: Just curious what is the specifications on your MacBook? Think of getting one for coding.

I'm using an earily 2011 17in MacBook Pro. Has the I7 2.2Ghz, 8GB DDR3, and a 258GB SSD. If you get an older one just throw a SSD and bump it up to 8GB and you will be solid! Anything younger than 2013 will be really good!
