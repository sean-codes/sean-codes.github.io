title: I started creating a website to practice and everything works but I messed up the CSS and now my color is gone. So I put the same color I had and it still doesn't work.

Make sure you save your code. Glue your fingers for CTRL - S. Everytime you type a line press CTRL-S. Also check out the Brackets editor. The live preview will let you see your code changes in real time!
