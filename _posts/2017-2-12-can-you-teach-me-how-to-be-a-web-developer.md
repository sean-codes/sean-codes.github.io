title: Can you teach me how to be a proper web developer?

What I like to do to practice or learn something is old fashioned repitition. Find a website you like a bunch and try to make a copy of something on it. Like the login page. Make the page function by console logging the information that page would need to output. Delete it and try again without inspecting the source!
