Hi! Start small and do many tutorials! I started with Game Maker back during Game Maker 6 9+ years ago and messed with Unity3D the past year. If you like coding and web I would certainly grab the PhaseJS game engine! PhaserJS is a total monster for gamedev let me know if you need anything else! You already know practice practice practice
