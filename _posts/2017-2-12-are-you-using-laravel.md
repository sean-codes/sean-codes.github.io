title: Are you using Laravel too?

I play around with a bit of anything. On personal projects I write most of my code on no frameworks. I like to keep focus on being organized and structured from the beginning making some frameworks sometimes get in the way. When working with a team I almost always want to be using a framework because it will help everyone be on the same page and structure!
