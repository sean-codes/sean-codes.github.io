title: I want to get to coding like writing English. I suspect it takes roughly 40 hours of writing not counting reading other code.

So you understand I was very hard headed. It took me almost 3 years of game dev before I could write my own code. In between that I was simply copy/paste other peoples tutorials like Lego pieces. And I kept making the Lego pieces smaller until I got down to the 2 pin ones and that gave me a lot more flexibility.
