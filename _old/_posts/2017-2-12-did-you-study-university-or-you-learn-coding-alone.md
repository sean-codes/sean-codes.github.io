title: Do you study at some university or you learn coding alone?
type: question

I learned coding over the internet. I wouldn't consider it being self taught because I still learned from many other people over the internet in the way you would learn at university. Three years after highschool I did try out a few classes in college for software development and hold a 4.0GPA
