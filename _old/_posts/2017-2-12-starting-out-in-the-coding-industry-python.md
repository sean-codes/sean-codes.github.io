title: What would you recommend for somebody starting out in the coding industry? Right now I'm learning Python
type: question

Python is a great first language for starting out! The best thing to do right now is focus on one language heavily. Then once you understand programming more in general you will be able to pick up and understand other language topics much easier. A super recommendation is try to get an internship with a development company as soon as possible. They will give you real experience that is hard to find coding by yourself.
