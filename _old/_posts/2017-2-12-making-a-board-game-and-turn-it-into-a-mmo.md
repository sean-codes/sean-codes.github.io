title: I'm really interested in making a board game and after that turn it into some kind of MMO. Do you have any experience?
type: question

My first game was actually a MMO that was over 50k lines of code and is still one of my favorite projects. I wrote it over a couple years during a live stream. It took me an extremely long time to write but I learned something important. Sometimes being extremely organized will get you much farther than being a super knowledgeable programmer. I wrote out a complete game documentation and built each piece to exact specification. It's still a project I can easily open up and work on even though the code was written 5-6 years ago when I first started programming.
