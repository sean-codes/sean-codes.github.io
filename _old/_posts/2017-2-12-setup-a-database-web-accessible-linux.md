title: I want to setup a database at work and I'm thinking that it should be web accessible. I would like to run is on a Linux machine. What are your thoughts off the top of your head? What problems could I face, should I use a different OS?

Ubuntu 16.04. Easy to setup and install MySQL or really anything pretty quickly. I usually run all my web software on Ubuntu with Node.JS or PHP using MySQL for databases. I prefer to just use the command line unless it's on a system with a bunch of resources and I want to have the CLI and a web browser open at the same time learning about setting something up. It is usually easier to simply SSH in and copy and paste from your main machine.
