title: Do you know which languages are primarily used in game development? I know JS, C# are ones. Are there any others?

I would not worry about that to much. Just about any language can be used for game development, C#, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Haxe, if you learn one language you will be able to pick up other ones. Find one you like to use for game dev and learn it to the best of your ability. Then move onto other languages
