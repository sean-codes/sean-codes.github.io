Coding can be pretty difficult to grasp. I started off my coding thing that I actually would like to code. That was games! If you find a topic that you like to code, web, apps, games, CLI, it won't seem so demotivating because you will be creating programs you like. It took me almost 3 years of game dev before I was able to really write my own code. Try to break problems in to smaller bits that you can solve separately
