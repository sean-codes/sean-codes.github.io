Game Dev is a place where I like to pour my learned knowledge into! If you want to start I would pick up any popular game engine! Unity3D or Game Maker Studio are my favorites. Go through their tutorials and joint he forums. It took me a few years of tutorials before I really was writing my own code! When start it's always best to start with the basics and master them first!
