title: Has your MacBook Pro ever shut off and you have not been able to turn it back on?

When I first got mine it was having an issue like that. The hard drive was not good and I changed it to an SSD. Then I broke the power cable and it wasn't actually charging. There was still a light on the cable so I thought it was okay. I would go to Best Buy or Microcenter and test on one of their power cables.
