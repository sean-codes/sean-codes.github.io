I think you should pick up any language that interests you. My favorite language was Game Maker Language and I got zero respect for using it. I was even making applications with it! But you should use the language you like rather than the best language. Java is very powerful. I typically use JavaScript because I'm okay with less performance for the trade of being able to run it anywhere. Plus the benefit of it being a fun language for me to use. You'll know you found the right language when you can't sleep at night because you are wrapped up dreaming of its functions and syntax and that problem your trying to solve using it!
