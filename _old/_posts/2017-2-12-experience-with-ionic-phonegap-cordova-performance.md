title: Do you have any experience with Ionic, PhoneGap, or Cordova? If so how do they perform?

Ionic is one of the best tools I've seen. What PhonGap and Cordova do is basically the same. They wrap your web app into a native webview so people can download your web app on the store. They also provide much much more than that allowing you to tap into native device interfaces like the GPS, gyroscope, audio, and storage. Their performance is extremely good. If you need more grab the Crosswalk plugin and at that point the difference in native and your web apps will be no difference
