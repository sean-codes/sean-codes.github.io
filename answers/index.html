    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">What do I have to download to develop a game and some applications for free</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/exblaker">@exblaker</a>: For 2D Game Maker Studio, For 3D Unity. For web apps I would start on w3schools.com and read the HTML, CSS, Javascript, and bootstrap tutorials.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">How did you learn to create iPhone apps and that stuff, what did you use to make them?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/kingjosh3">@kingjosh3</a>: I am really into Web Development and in any IDE for making native apps there is a component called Web View which allows you to build apps using Web tech then put it inside a Web view. Look up hybrid apps and cordova. Go to Microsoft and their community edition which has cordova built in. They have great tutorials! :]</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Hey Sean, quick question. Where do you think is the best source for JavaScript training? Do you have any tips for just learning that language? Thanks</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/jverdi23">@jverdi23</a>: I honestly started by learning everything off w3schools.com. To get better I would consistently take on projects that are way more than I should have been able to handle. I make a plan and stick to it. If you can't solve something break it into smaller problems that you can solve individually. When I start coding in any language I would do to 10-20 times. Create something small a website or game. Then delete it and do it again until it drilled into my head.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I've been wanting to get into game dev. How do you like it? Any Pointers?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/veryangryshahzoda">@veryangryshahzoda</a>: Game Dev is a place where I like to pour my learned knowledge into! If you want to start I would pick up any popular game engine! Unity3D or Game Maker Studio are my favorites. Go through their tutorials and joint he forums. It took me a few years of tutorials before I really was writing my own code! When start it's always best to start with the basics and master them first!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">How long did it take to learn HTML?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/linartsu">@linartsu</a>: I learned coding over 3-5 years before touching HTML. So once I found HTML I was able to pick it up within a few months.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Are your using Laravel too?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/ghaziimuharam">@ghaziimuharam</a>: I play around with a bit of anything. On personal projects I write most of my code on no frameworks. I like to keep focus on being organized and structured from the beginning making some frameworks sometimes get in the way. When working with a team I almost always want to be using a framework because it will help everyone be on the same page and structure!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Which language do you prefer?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/devgeek">@devgeek</a>: Currently I have been hitting JavaScript pretty hard but I'm into PHP, Python, Coldfusion, C#. I think all languages are cool! :]</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Do you study on some university or you learn coding alone?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/vespageorge30">@vespageorge30</a>: I learned coding over the internet. I wouldn't consider it being self taught because I still learned from many other people over the internet in the way you would learn at university. Three years after highschool I did try out a few classes in college for software development and hold a 4.0GPA</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">What is your game engine written in</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/cbooker26">@cbooker26</a>: The engine is written in plain JavaScript!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">What is the keyboard your using?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/peacockethan">@peacockethan</a>: It's the Razer Ornata :]</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I want to get to coding like writing english. I suspect it takes roughly 40 hours of writing not counting reading other code.</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/scipioakaceaser">@scipioakaceaser</a>: So you understand I was very hard headed. It took me almost 3 years of game dev before I could write my own code. In between that I was simply copy/paste other peoples tutorials like lego pieces. And I kept making the lego pieces smaller until I got down to the 2 pin ones and that gave me a lot more flexibility.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Where can I become a programmer. Where can i start?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/warismunadar">@warismunadar</a>: I think one of the best places to get started is w3schools.com. Go through each of the tutorials for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I think starting with web tech is more exciting than other languages because it is very visual when you create or change something.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Can you teach me how to be a proper web developer??</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/permanar_">@permanar_</a>: What I like to do to practice or learn something is old fashioned repitition. Find a website you like a bunch and try to make a copy of something on it. Like the login page. Make the page function by console logging the information that page would need to output. Delete it and try again without inspecting the source!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Haha where you from man!</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/stackboi_yg">@stackboi_yg</a>: US city of Chicago :]</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Do you develop game for other people too, I might be lokoing for someone</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/allonestudios">@allonestudios</a>: I do freelance small projects as long as you have complete game design documentation written.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Has your MacBook Pro ever shut off and you have not been able to turn it back on?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/daniraay">@daniraay</a>: When I first got mine it was havin an issue like that. The hard drive was not good and I changed it to an SSD. Then I broke the power cable and it wasn't actually charging. There was still a light on the cable so I thought it was okay. I would go to Best Buy or Microcenter and test on one of their power cables.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I've been wanting to learn swift but I do not know where to start. Is it pretty difficult to comprehend? I know HTML, CSS, and some JQuery</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/daniraay">@daniraay</a>: You'll be fine! Swift is a newer language so it's good easy to catch on! You can also keep using Web technologies and simply build Web Apps and put them into apps called hybrid apps.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I want to setup a database at work and I'm thinking that it should be web accessible. I would like to run is on a Linux machine. What are your thoughts off the top of your head? What problems could I face, should I use a different OS?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/j.frank1980">@j.frank1980</a>: Ubuntu 16.04. Easy to setup and install MySQL or really anything pretty quickly. I usually run all my web software on Ubuntu with Node.JS or PHP using MySQL for databases. I prefer to just use the command line unless it's on a system with a bunch of resources and I want to have the CLI and a web browser open at the same time learning about setting something up. It is usually easier to simply SSH in and copy and paste from your main machine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I'm a full stack web developer and starting to get into coding games. Any recommendations for someone new at coding 2D games?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/awakenmarketingsolutions">@awakenmarketingsolutions</a>: Hi! Start small and do many tutorials! I started with Game Maker back during Game Maker 6 9+ years ago and messed with Unity3D the past year. If you like coding and web I would certainly grab the PhaseJS game engine! Phaser JS is a total monster for gamedev let me know if you need anything else! You already know practice practice practice</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Looking to buy a laptop. Can you tell me a good laptop under 1,000 USD</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/aadi._n">@aadi._n</a>: You can't go wrong with a macbook that has an i5/i7 processor. They are very comfortable for coding and multitasking vs windows 10. For Windows I would look into XPS 15, Sony Vaio Flip 15, anything Lenovo has good build quility. You should buy used laptops have pretty low resale value and some from 3-4 years ago have very high performance per dollar. I current use a 2011 17in MacBook Pro that I purchased for 900 USD</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">On what operating system will this game be on?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/elmansariyoussef">@elmansariyoussef</a>: The game I make will be on Android, IOS, and Steam for sure. The game engine I built can run on anything that can run a modern browser!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Oh so you're also a fan of no copyright songs? Try to listen to Vexento tracks. They are amazing</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/elmansariyoussef">@elmansariyoussef</a>: I literally listen to anything but I totally like NCS a bunch!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I want to make a simulation game. How do I start and also what is the first step to work on?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/danizan_dani">@danizan_dani</a>: For your game what you need to do before anythting is go online and search for a game design documentation template. You need to write out your entire game start to finish on paper first. Then you will have an idea of the parts that you will be able to build. You'll be able to do this in small pieces at a time rather than looking at the entire project as a whole.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">My friend and I want to learn app development but what language should I learn and program?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/muhammad_sabr_">@muhammad_sabr_</a>: I would learn Web Development. Javascript, CSS, HTML5. Learn how those three work then learn a bit about some frameworks like BootStrap, Materialize. Then you can use applications like Cordova to quickly wrap your apps and deploy! Learning those will take much time so stay focused!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">What would you recommend for somebody starting out in the coding industry? Right now I'm learning Python</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/j.o.d.s.o.n">@j.o.d.s.o.n</a>: Python is a great first language for starting out! The best thing to do right now is focus on one language heavily. Then once you understand programming more in general you will be able to pick up and understand other language topics much easier. A super recommendation is try to get an internship with a development company as soon as possible. They will give you real experience that is hard to find coding by yourself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I want to start a video game. Some how can you help me with any ideas for my game.</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/traywitthemac11_808mafia">@traywitthemac11_808mafia</a>: I think you should start with a complete documentation. Before I ever start a project I write one usually around 3-20 pages with details about each part of the game. I do this for personal and professional projects</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Are you using Unity for development?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/willclarkmedia">@willclarkmedia</a>: I wrote my game engine from scratch using javascript and HTML5 canvas</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">How do I learn more about coding PHP for Android?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/programming.de">@programming.de</a>: PHP is a server side language and you might not be using it for your Android project. I would take a look into HTML, CSS, and Javascript by making websites. Then package them inside an apps webview using Cordova.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Are you a programmer? How old are you?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/jorgemerlo3">@jorgemerlo3</a>: Hi! Yes and I'm 23 :]</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I'm really interested in making a board game and after that turn it into some kind of MMO. Do you have any experience?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/sousatg">@sousatg</a>: My first game was actually a MMO that was over 50k lines of code and is still one of my favorite projects. I wrote it over a couple years during a live stream. It took me an extremely long time to write but I learned something important. Sometimes being extremely organized will get you much farther than being a super knowledgable programmer. I wrote out a complete game documentation and built each piece to exact specification. It's still a project I can easily open up and work on even though the code was written 5-6 years ago when I first started programming.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Do you have any experice with Ionic, PhoneGap, or Cordova? If so how do they perform?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/sousatg">@sousatg</a>: Ionic is one of the best tools I've seen. What Phongap and Cordova do is basically the same. They wrap your web app into a native webview so people can download your web app on the store. They also provide much much more than that allowing you to tap into native device interfaces like the GPS, gyroscope, audio, and storage. Their performance is extremly good. If you need more grab the Crosswalk plugin and at that point the difference in native and your web apps will be no difference</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Do you make your own graphics and sprites?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/vespageorge30">@vespageorge30</a>: Yes! I make them in Aseprite! I got my style simply by copying other pixel artists work then kind of forming it into my own. I'm not very good with art past 64x64 pixels :]</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Where did you learn to use SQL?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/eldiabloquapo13">@eldiabloquapo13</a>: Learned the basics of SQL from w3schools.com. What you learn from the basic tutorials can usually get you through just about anything. I did not get very good with it until using it everyday at work and asking lots of questions to people much more skilled than me.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I was wondering if you could teach me PHP?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/anonymous_tseeker">@anonymous_tseeker</a>: I wish! I think though you would be much better starting with some online sites like w3schools or codeacademy. They will do a much better job helping you get started than I ever could!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Good morning Sean. I was wondering what programs do you use?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/anonymous_tseeker">@anonymous_tseeker</a>: My favorites right now are Sublime Text 3, Heidi SQL, and Google Chrome!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Just curious what is the specifications on your MacBook? Think of getting one for coding.</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/l.companero">@l.companero</a>: I'm using an earily 2011 17in MacBook Pro. Has the I7 2.2Ghz, 8GB DDR3, and a 258GB SSD. If you get an older one just throw a SSD and bump it up to 8GB and you will be solid! Anything younger than 2013 will be really good!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Already have Unity3D but I ended up just writing what they wrote not knowing why. So looking for inspiration for some good techniques to learn coding</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/stef_nielson">@stef_nielson</a>: Okay! That is alright! That happens to everyone. It's hard to grasp code because it's actually a different way of thinking. It's actually much more simple! But that makes it weird. What I would do is try codeacademy course or two so you can get the basics. Write down these: Variables, Operators, Conditions, Loops, and Input/Output. With those few things you can basically do just about anything with code. If you find out exactly how each of those work you will be able to understand code a bit better!</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I started creating a website to practice and everything works but I messed up the CSS and now my color is gone. So I put the same color I had and it still doesn't work.</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/angry_randall20">@angry_randall20</a>: Make sure you save your code. Glue your fingers for CTRL - S. Everytime you type a line press CTRL-S. Also check out the Brackets editor. The live preview will let you see your code changes in real time!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Do you still use Game Maker Studio?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/edushola">@edushola</a>: GM Studio is still one of my favorite programs on the planet. I have made desktop applications, games, video, sounds, everything with it. I really like game mechanics more than game design which is sort of why I wanted to make my own engine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">What software do I need to code? Whats the code editor you use?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/javvyy._">@javvyy._</a>: I use Sublime Text 3 at Work. Atom at Home. I also like Brackets</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I have been trying to lean code. I don't know how to keep motivation, learning code isn't easy.</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/innocent_rathogwa">@innocent_rathogwa</a>: Coding can be pretty difficult to grasp. I started off my coding thing that I actually would like to code. That was games! If you find a topic that you like to code, web, apps, games, CLI, it wo't seem so demotivating because you will be creating programs you like. It took me almost 3 years of game dev before I was able to really write my own code. Try to break problems in to smaller bits that you can solve separately</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I want to ask toy that OS (Operating System) do you use for coding Node.JS apps? I don't know if windows is good.</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/jk_me_rolling">@jk_me_rolling</a>: I am typically under Windows 10 all day. I stickto Web based languages so the OS shouldn't matter. Use git bash and do npm install devtool -g and run your node app using devtool myNodeApp.js. Pick any OS you like Linux, Windows, Mac I like Windows on desktop and Mac for mobile/laptop</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Is your code opensource? What is your github account?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/jrcoimbra">@jrcoimbra</a>: I try to get all my code opensource! Here is the link to my github account: <a href="https://github.com/sean-codes" target="_blank">sean-codes</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Do you code everything from scratch?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/ericatomes">@ericatomes</a>: With my engine yes everything is from scratch. I do enjoy very much using game engines like GMS and Unity3D for getting higher quality and faster builds. The game engine is mostly for personal projects right now.</p>

        <h5 class="questionText">How are you like Linux so far?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/aaronraff_">@aaronraff_</a>: I have to do some research so I can program my mouse shortcuts. It looks and runs fabulous but I'm a power user with Windows 10 so I'm going back to focus on my software and when I have some more time I will keep linux on this drive till next time.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I alreayd know Python but I want to lean a new language I was thinking Java. What do you think?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/r.y_ley">@r.y_ley</a>: I think you should pick up any language that interests you. My favorite language was Game Maker Language and I got zero respect for using it. I was even making applications with it! But you should use the language you like rather than the best language. Java is very powerful. I typically use JavaScript because I'm okay with less performance for the trade of being able to run it anywhere. Plus the benifit of it being a fun langauge for me to use. You'll know you found the right language when you can't sleep at night because you are wrapped up dreaming of its functions and syntax and that problem your trying to solve using it!</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">There is a lot of sites like codeacademy and Lynda and so many languages</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/unspeaking">@unspeaking</a>: I understand that is can be quite intimidating! I got into coding making small games. Over time I got into modifying network servers in c#, c++, and Java. Now I do full stack web development using javascript, PHP, coldfusion. You might notice that is a lot of languages to be messing with! Once you learn one langauge you can learn other ones very quickly. I would push you to just start with Javascript and web tech. My favorite starting place is w3schools.com.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Do you know any good online resources for GML. Forums sites that have project files anything really. I need practice.</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/deadtoro">@deadtoro</a>: The tutorials that come is GM Studio and exceptional. You will also be able to find a bunch of tutorials on the Game Maker forums.

        <h5 class="questionText">Do you know someone who uses Unity3D mainly?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/robby_carter_">@robby_carter_</a>: I think just about every 3D game dev startup in the past 2 years:] </p>

    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I want to use Xamarin for cross platform development. Isn't wrapping web apps a little bit slow and doesn't feel like a native app?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/gravity_gamestudio">@gravity_gamestudio</a>: JavaScript is pretty fast already and CSS can access the GPU. If you use the right tools and techniques you should not be able to tell the difference in a Web App and native.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">I will be glad if you can share anything I can study and become a good programmer. I have little knowledge about Python, VB, HTML, CSS, and MATLAB</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/bazzly">@bazzly</a>: Perfect! What I would do is look into responsive design and hybrid apps. These apps run in a web view and can act like a native app. You will only need to focus on web tech.</p>

        <h5 class="questionText">I want to learn HTML. I've been going through a book for so long, I really don't learn much because there is nobody to put my through</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/lord_of_a_thousand_worlds">@lord_of_a_thousand_worlds</a>: The best way to learn for me is by doing. Find a website you like and practice by trying to recreate a part of it. Do this for all the sites you like. If you have to inspect the source code delete the project and start over.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h5 class="questionText">Do you know which languages are primarily used in game development? I know JS, C# are ones. Are there any others?</h5>
        <p class="questionAnswer"><a href="https://instagram.com/_.ehs3._">@_.ehs3._</a>: I would not worry about that to much. Just about any language can be used for game development, C#, C++, Java, Python, Javascript, Haxe, if you learn one language you will be able to pick up other ones. Find one you like to use for game dev and learn it to the best of your ability. Then move onto other languages</p>
